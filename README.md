# OOP Battle Game

**OOP Battle Game** is a small 2D project developed in **C# with Windows
Forms (SharpDevelop)**.\
It was created as part of a guided class project at **ETEC de Embu**, designed
to **practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as
**inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism** through an interactive
battle between a hero and an enemy.
